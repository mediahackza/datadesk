fossil_emissions,Emissions Fossil Fuels,,,"The burning of fossil fuels is the biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases, of which carbon dioxide is just one, trap heat in the atmosphere, causing temperatures on the Earth’s surface to increase.","Fossil fuels are burned to produce energy, generate heat and electricity and power the engines of vehicles, ships and planes. Seventy-three percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from fossil fuels burned to produce energy.",EMBER,Ember,"Independent European non-profit think tank Ember releases an annual report on the state of energy, focussing on the shift to renewables to cut down carbon emissions.

If temperatures increase extreme weather events, such as flooding, droughts, wildfires and hurricanes, will increase in frequency and intensity.","Burning fossil fuels to create energy produces the most greenhouse gasses compared with other industries. If countries change how they source their energy from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, they will decrease their emissions.",EMBER,Ember,"Independent European non-profit think tank Ember releases an annual report on the state of energy, focussing on the shift to renewables to cut down carbon emissions.
